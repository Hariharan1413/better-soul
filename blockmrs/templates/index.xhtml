          <p>
            bettersoul is a privacy concious, decentralized, blockchain-backed,
            medical record system for the 21st Century.
          </p>
          <p>
            It stores patient records in IPFS using state-of-the-art asymetric
            encryption giving patients control over their health data.

        <h3>Privacy Concious</h3>
        <p>
          bettersoul is designed with the patient's privacy in mind. bettersoul
          generates a new public-private key for every transaction on the
          blockchain and each block has a constant size. This ensures that
          malicious actors cannot infer anything about a patient by inspecting
          the blockchain.
        </p>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3>Distributed</h3>
        <p>
          bettersoul uses a distrubuted filesystem called
          <i>InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)</i> to store medical records.
          This creates a common way for medical service providers to access the
          latest, up-to-date patient data.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3>Blockchain-Backed</h3>
        <p>
          bettersoul takes advantage of the latest blockchain technology to
          allow for seamless transfer of medical data. Blocks on the blockchain
          are signed and ecrypted to ensure authenticity and privacy.
